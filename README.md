Experiment 0: Replicate UMAP and t-SNE plots for the given dataset. Establish if these embeddings are stable or not under different hyperparameter settings. 

Experiment 1: Test PaCMAP on the dataset, explore its performance compared to UMAP and t-SNE, and analyze the stability of the embeddings under varying parameters.

Experiment 2: Use work from Rashomon set for DR NeurIPS submitted paper to produce and establish Consensus embeddings
